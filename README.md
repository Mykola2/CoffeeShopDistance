# CoffeeShopDistance
Coffee Central


Is it just a fad or is it here to stay? You’re not sure, but the steadily increasing number of
coffee shops that are opening in your hometown has certainly become quite a draw.
Apparently, people have become so addicted to coffee that apartments that are close to
many coffee shops will actually fetch higher rents.


This has come to the attention of a local real-estate company. They are interested in
identifying the most valuable locations in the city in terms of their proximity to large numbers
of coffee shops. They have given you a map of the city, marked with the locations of coffee
shops. Assuming that the average person is willing to walk only a fixed number of blocks for
their morning coffee, you have to find the location from which one can reach the largest
number of coffee shops. As you are probably aware, your hometown is built on a square grid
layout, with blocks aligned on north-south and east-west axes. Since you have to walk along
streets, the distance between intersections (a; b) and (c; d) is |a – c| + | b – d|.
